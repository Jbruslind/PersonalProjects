#	Music

I've played Viola for around 12 years now and I have really enjoyed playing at the amaetuer level. This directory contains music that I've 
found over my searches in the internet that I'd like to play or am currently practicing. I use MuseScore 3 to do 
most of my transpositions and exports. 

Feel free to download any that seem interesting (these are for almost all for solo Viola or otherwise Viola main)
