#	Talking GladOS Clock 

This project I started in Fall of 2017 to create a talking clock using an arduino paired with a speaker, sd card, real time clock (rtc), and LEDs. The 
idea was to have the SD card have prerecorded messages (such as words or phrases) that would play during certain time and light up LEDs placed in strategic 
locations. The end effect would be a clock that appeared like GladOS from the Portal 2 game that would tell the time to you in a condending way. 

## Phrases

Orignally I found a website that would allow for voice clips to be morphed into sounding like GladOS however this turned out to not work very well as 
the waiting period for generation was ~1 week. To get around this, I instead went into the game files for Portal 2 and took quotes directly from the 
game itself. I then used these in place of the time statements (so instead of saying "it's 1 o clock" in her voice, I settled for a random quote). 

## PCB 

I made the design on a breadboard at first and it seemed to work out ok (with some minor connection issues with the wires). I then moved the design 
to a PCB in order to consolidate the modules and to reduce the overall need for wires everywhere. The design is shown below:




##	UWROV19

This project is the Underwater ROV team 2018-2019 circuit board files. All of these were custom designed to fit with 
the ROV.
