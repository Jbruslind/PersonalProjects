#	Music

This directory contains music that I've found over my searches in the internet that I'd like to play or am currently practiciing. I use MuseScore 3 to do 
most of my transpositions and exports. 

Feel free to download any that seem interesting (these are for almost all for solo Viola or otherwise Viola main)
