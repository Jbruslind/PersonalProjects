#	Stewart Platform 

This project is in direct conjunction with the Raspberry Pi Stellar Photography project and serves as an automation tool to control a camera for positioning 
towards different areas of the night sky. 

The basic idea of a stewart platform is to have 6 independently controlled servo motors move to various radial postiions which will then move 6 sides of an 
end effector. The combintaiton of the distance vectors will allow the end effector to be moved in 6 degrees of freedom (xyz and spherical yaw, pitch, roll). 

The design is fairly simple: Have 6 equidistant servo motors control the vertical positions of 6 sides of a hexagon end effector. Based on the rotational angle 
of these positions you can determine the area in 3D space of the center of the end effector through reverse kinematics. My current challenge is creating these 
kinematic equations for the servo control based on my physical positions (and then fine tuning the design basd on my inital tests). 

##	UWROV19

This project is the Underwater ROV team 2018-2019 circuit board files. All of these were custom designed to fit with 
the ROV.
