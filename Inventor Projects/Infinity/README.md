# Making the Stones 
After designing each of the pendants I used Shapeways to 3D print each one in a different metal material. The cheapest options available were Bronze, Brass, and Stainless Steel. Bronze and 
Brass having a minumum price/part of $12.50 and Steel being $15. The tritium vials were bought online from [MixGlo](https://www.mixglo.com/) in the 3x11mm vials ($9.50/unit). The chain
for each one I just found on Amazon. Feel free to steal any of the designs or make your own.

## Space
This one was the first pendant I designed, mostly because it was the easiest to think of. The design is the 3D representation of a tessaract, with a core in the center
for the tritum vial to sit. The Tessaract was a core icon in the Marvel movies (being in, or referenced in a majority of them) so I figured what shape to better
emulate the Space stone than a tesseract. The material was chosen to be stainless steel since none of the other available metals really fit the color theme. 
The tritum vial color was Ice Blue.

## Time 
The time stone was also pretty easy to design since it had a very distinct shape in the Marvel movies. For this design I did my best to emulate the pendant worn in Doctor Strange 
and used the socercer's symbol to extrude a pattern on the pendant. The material for this pendant was Brass as it had the closest color to the metal in the movies. The tritium 
vial color was Green.

## Mind 
The mind stone was a little diffcult to design as I didn't know what shape would properly emulate the stone in the movies. I settled on the stone holder used in Vision's head first seen 
in Age of Ultron. I took a little creative liberties to make sure the shape was able to fit the vial properly. The material for this pendant was stainless steel since it seemed to most 
closely match the metal holder in the movies. The tritium vial color was Yellow.

## Power 
The only symbol I could think of for the power stone was the orb seen in Guardians of the Galaxy that contained it. Unfortunatly I'm not talented enough to create all the intricate shapes/symbols
as seen on the orb and even so my computer wouldn't be able to render all those facets. Instead I opted for a geometrical shape that was similar to the orb (dodecahedron) and combined it with a center holder
that had extruded hexagons cut into it. Credit for the dodecahedron shape goes to Thingiverse user [nevitdilmen](https://www.thingiverse.com/nevitdilmen/about), be sure to check it out on Thingiverse
[here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1344625) The material chosen for this pendant was Brass. This goes against the actual color seen in the movie but I thought that having a 
gold-ish color contrasted with the purple vial would create a nice effect. The tritium vial color was Purple.

## Reality 
Personally this one is my favorite, mostly because of how cool it looks and the fact that it almost killed my computer trying to render. 
The reality stone was hard to design for since its symbol in the movies was literally a liquid. After a ton of searching online I found a really cool design by user [Geof](https://twitter.com/gmweed/status/928268167981518848)
that captured exactly what I was looking for. You can check out the original files [here](https://www.3dizingof.com/shop/free-designs/borromean-vase/). I took this model and extruded the center piece 
to be a holder for the vial and then added some effects to make it a little easier to see. The material for this pendant was Brass. The tritium vial color was Red.

## Soul
This one was actually the hardest to design for since it had no concrete symbol in the entire movie. Some ideas I had come up with some friends were the Spires seen on Voromir, a stick figure with 
a "splat" effect (due to some events in the movie Infinty War), and a hooded figure. I ended up choosing the hooded figure porition with just the hood. I found a great 3D model which was originally 
supposed to be for DND/Tabletop RPG type stuff, but worked great for my uses. I added the holder mount and extruded a heart inside the center to be a little more direct with the symbol meaning (Since
in the movie the stone could only be obtained by "Giving up something you love"). The material chosen was steel since using either brass/bronze didn't really fit well with the color theme. The 
tritium vial color was Orange.
