#Personal projects

This section contains all the personal projects I'm currently working on or have worked on/finished 
(who am I kidding they're never finished). Each directory should have it's own README with details about 
what the project is and the steps I took to do it. Some of my personal favorites are: 

##Infinity Stone Pendants 
This project was inspired by Marvel's blockbuster hits (Avengers and their derivatives) and because of a 
gift I had made previously for an old high school friend. There isn't any functional point to this, mostly
just for sentimental value and because I can. 

The design revolves around the use of [Tritium](https://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/pdfs/Fact_Sheets/January-2013-Fact-Sheet-Tritium_e.pdf) 
which is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It's not radioactive in the sense that it'll cause damage, 
just enough to cause some cool glowing effects. The radiation is low levels of Beta-particles and is not
damaging unless ingested (so just don't eat the vials....)

Here's a picture of the full assembly
