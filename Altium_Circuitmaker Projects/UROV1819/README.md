#	UROV19

I have been involved with the OSU Robotics Club Underwater team for around 4 years (as of Dec 2019). I work 
as the electrical team lead and help manage the various electrical components that are necessary to make an Underwater 
robot work. All of the circuit boards are custom designed either by myself or someone in my team and are tested/assembled 
in house. Initially I used Altium Student to design my boards, however I realized that Altium relased a free (lesser) version of 
itself called CircuitMaker that I have been using ever since 2017. One aspect of CircuitMaker is that all projects are 
published on the CircuitMaker cloud and are freely available for anyone to use. All of the projects below 
are no exception and anyone is free to use them as they wish. 

## Power Board (PDB)

This was a project that I was in charge of for most of my time here in the UROV team. This specific design 
uses the LM5117 Synchronous Buck Controller to convert a 48V input to a 12V output for the ROV to run off of. 
48V is the standard voltage that the competition we compete in gives us to work with. This board requires 
a large amount of current to flow through it at any given time (as the motors also run off it) and so 
it was build with thermal considerations in mind. It was necessary to both include a heat sink as well as 
thermal power planes in order to dissipate the heat generated by the MOSFETs.

##	LM5085 Buck Converter
Unfortunately, the LM5117 had some weird MOSFET ringing issues in it's design and so the synchronous function 
did not work properly. We needed a new board on short notice (<2 months) and so I used a non-synchronous 
solution found through some online researching.  This project aims to take the LM5085 
Buck controller IC made by Texas Instruments and employ it towards reducing our competition standard 
48V input to our system standard 12V. The same statement in the LM5117 applies to this design in that 
in was designed with power planes and heat sinks in order to dissipate the thermal power gneerated by the MOSFETs.

This project is like 3 years in the making. All it's supposed to do is control some simple LEDs and a water pump
for a generic plant in a pot. This is supposed to be like a simple arduino project, but it's taken me 3 years and
3 iterations to actually get it done. To be fair, each time I'll work on it for around a week, get distracted for 
6 months and come back to it. 

But it was a fun project to work on and I think the recent revision looks pretty cool.

##	AUX2

This project is the Underwater ROV team 2018-2019 circuit board files. All of these were custom designed to fit with 
the ROV.
