#	Raspberry Pi Stellar Photography

This is a Work in Progress project (aren't they all?) in that I haven't put much work into the design or assembly yet. 

The overview is that I really like the idea of stellar photography and I'd like to have a device that is able to automatically plot/photograph specific parts 
of the night sky based on inputs from a user. So far my idea is to have a mounted camera on a Stewart Platform controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Using the DLSR 
control library (gPhoto) for the Raspberry Pi found ![here](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php) 

Using these 2 tools I can use a GPS to plot the path of a specific area of space in real time and take a long term image of that area for later recombination 
into a photo.
