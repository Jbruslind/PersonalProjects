These projects include those that were made specifically for the OSU Robotics Club 

### Business Cards

I saw a creator on Circuitmaker had made PCBs in the form of business cards and thought the idea would be a great idea to promote the club (as well as my own 
skills). So I created a simple design that would emulate that. The end result is shown below: 


All the design files include the schematics (none are electrically useful) and the gerbers to order them from a manufacturer. 

### Circuits For Kids

This project was actually really fun and I'm glad I decided to do it. While in the OSU Robotics Club I would particiapate/host a variety of kids events 
focused on getting the younger students excited about technology and the possibility of robotics. With that in mind I created a few custom PCBs that would illustrate
certain skills or ideas. 

#### Fruit Piano

The Fruit Piano project is based on the Makey Makey product line (found [here](https://makeymakey.com/))
in which you can use the human body as a resistive element in a circuit to produce sound based on touch. The general idea is that you would connect the 
pads surrounding the circuit board to various fruits or otherwise high water content/conductive materials, have someone hold a grounding wire (placed on 
the arduino wire or external source) and have them complete the circuit between the elements. The result would be the arduino would detect this voltage 
change (based on the voltage pull down) and would send a specific sound frequency to the output headers. This could be amplified by a speaker and you could 
play notes as if using a keyboard. 

The project ended up being a huge hit with kids, who really enjoyed mashing fruit to play notes. 

####Issues 

I neglected to put an actual dedicated ground connection on the board and so the only way to connect to ground is the place a wire on the arduino ISP header pins. 

The pads were also very difficult to hook up alligator clips (any movement would cause continuity issues) so for the next version it would be good to 
include some kind of dedicated mounting spot for alligator clips to hook on to.

### UROV 1819

### UROV 1920



The design revolves around the use of [Tritium](https://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/pdfs/Fact_Sheets/January-2013-Fact-Sheet-Tritium_e.pdf) 
which is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It's not radioactive in the sense that it'll cause damage, 
just enough to cause some cool glowing effects. The radiation is low levels of Beta-particles and is not
damaging unless ingested (so just don't eat the vials). With it as a core I created geometric designs 
corresponding to each stone and their back story/ability. 

Here's a picture of the full assembly. The metal colors are pretty off due to Inventor having weird colors...

### Valentine's Day

This project is like 3 years in the making. All it's supposed to do is control some simple LEDs and a water pump
for a generic plant in a pot. This is supposed to be like a simple arduino project, but it's taken me 3 years and
3 iterations to actually get it done. To be fair, each time I'll work on it for around a week, get distracted for 
6 months and come back to it.
