#	Personal projects

This section contains all the personal projects I'm currently working on or have worked on/finished 
(who am I kidding they're never finished). Each directory should have it's own README with details about 
what the project is and the steps I took to do it. Some of my personal favorites are: 

##	Infinity Stone Pendants 
This project was inspired by Marvel's blockbuster hits (Avengers and their derivatives) and because of a 
gift I had made previously for an old high school friend. There isn't any functional point to this, mostly
just for sentimental value.

The design revolves around the use of [Tritium](https://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/pdfs/Fact_Sheets/January-2013-Fact-Sheet-Tritium_e.pdf) 
which is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It's not radioactive in the sense that it'll cause damage, 
just enough to cause some cool glowing effects. The radiation is low levels of Beta-particles and is not
damaging unless ingested (so just don't eat the vials). Using this as a core, I created geometric designs 
corresponding to each stone and their back story/ability. 

Here's a picture of the full assembly. The metal colors are pretty off due to Inventor having weird colors...

##	Automatic Terrarium 

This project is like 3 years in the making. All it's supposed to do is control some simple LEDs and a water pump
for a generic plant in a pot. This is supposed to be like a simple arduino project, but it's taken me 3 years and
3 iterations to actually get it done. To be fair, each time I'll work on it for around a week, get distracted for 
6 months and come back to it. 


But it was a fun project to work on and I think the recent revision looks pretty cool.

##	UWROV19

This project is the Underwater ROV team 2018-2019 circuit board files. All of these were custom designed to fit with 
the ROV.
