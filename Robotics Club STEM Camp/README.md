#	OSU Robotics STEM Camp

Throughout my time in the OSU Robotics Club (around 4 years as of April 2020) I've been involved in a variety of STEM camps or otherwise educational workshops
for younger students either as host or assistant. This directory contains all the code necessary for a STEM camp focused on environmental sensors and 
basic arduino programming. Mostly I use this space to host any releveant arduino libraries/code that might be needed for the camp/workshop.
